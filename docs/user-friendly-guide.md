# 📚 PMOSkills Onboarding Handbook — Multi-Audience Portal

Welcome to the official **PMOSkills Onboarding Handbook and Master Portal**! PMOSkills is a state-of-the-art, executable PMO reference architecture built strictly upon the **PMI PMBOK® 8th Edition** (Primary Authority) and **23 secondary companion standards** (Secondary Authority).

This repository is uniquely engineered as a **dual-purpose operating system** designed to serve both **Human Practitioners** and **Autonomous AI Agents / Developer Tools** with equal fidelity and deterministic precision.

To help you get started, we have organized the entire documentation suite into **four specialized, high-impact tracks**:

## 🎨 Unified Project Lifecycle SOP Mappings

Depending on your delivery framework, you can follow standard operational routes mapping through our Executable Skills (`skills/`) and Templates (`artifacts/`):

### 1. Predictive (Waterfall) Lifecycle Routing
```
[Setup Governance] ➔ [Project Initiating] ➔ [Triple-Constraints Baselines] ➔ [Monitoring & Gate Reviews] ➔ [Closure & Transitions]
```
1. **Setup:** Consult **[Establishing Governance](human-practitioners/authority-routing.md)** and skill `SKL-01-01`.
2. **Initiate:** Follow processes `PR01`/`PR02`, instantiating business cases and project charters (`A01` / `A04`).
3. **Plan:** Execute Pack 03 skills, developing the integrated Project Management Plan (`A14`) including Schedule (`A15`) and Budget (`A16`).
4. **Monitor & Control:** Track thresholds using `threshold-router.md` and manage change control issues via `A18` / `A19`.
5. **Close:** Execute administrative archivals via `A24` and lessons learned records (`A21`).

### 2. Adaptive (Agile) Lifecycle Routing
```
[Define Vision] ➔ [Collaborative Story Mapping] ➔ [Sprint Planning & Execution] ➔ [continuous Waste Auditing] ➔ [Value Transition]
```
1. **Vision:** Define vision and product backlogs using template `A28`.
2. **Story Mapping:** Plan releases using story mapping practices outlined in skill `SKL-07-02`.
3. **Sprint Run:** Manage Kanban boards and burn-down analytics via `SKL-07-03` and sprint backlogs (`A30`).
4. **Waste Testing:** Eliminate overhead using the programmatic waste auditor `shared/validators/waste-test.md` at sprint boundaries.
5. **Release:** Transition features to benefits realization via `A24`.
