## [4.7.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Phase 6 Test Suites:**
  - 48 individual skill-level deterministic test suites under `tests/skill-tests/` (each containing 9 machine-readable test cases covering happy path, prerequisites, thresholds, ESG, constraints, waste, etc.).
  - 7 cross-skill integration flow test suites under `tests/integration-tests/` tracing artifact flows across at least two lifecycle phases.
  - Interactive Mermaid-based lifecycle flow diagrams for all integration tests.
  - Master catalogs `tests/skill-tests/index.md` and `tests/integration-tests/index.md`.
- **Phase 7 Quality Audit:**
  - Full quality review and validation of all 57 newly generated test files.
  - Active status and actual flat file structure documented in `tests/README.md`.

### Fixed
- **NC-001, NC-002, NC-003 Resolved:** Renamed legacy mixed-case artifact files in `artifacts/planning-and-baselines/` to strict lowercase kebab-case (e.g., `A14-integrated-project-management-plan.md`, `A15-schedule-model-and-baseline-record.md`, `A16-financial-management-and-cost-baseline-record.md`).
- **NC-004, NC-005, NC-006 Resolved:** Formally documented structural cleanups of root directories and duplicate plan standard files in `QUALITY-STANDARDS.md`.
- Updated all cross-references and links to lowercase kebab-case in `docs/how-to-use-artifacts.md` and `QUALITY-STANDARDS.md`.

## [2.12.0] — 2026-05-31

### Audit Findings — Phase C4 Path Correction

Audit performed on all `reference/` and root directories to verify C4 process record locations.

**Findings:**
- PR01–PR10: Confirmed **missing from repository** — listed as complete in v2.11.0 but commits were not preserved. Rebuild required.
- PR11–PR40: Exist at root `C4-Process-Records/` (wrong location) and at `reference/C4-Process-Records/` (wrong subfolder name). Canonical target is `reference/processes/`.
- `C5-KA-Crossref/KA-Crossref-Index.md`: Exists at root. Must migrate to `reference/KA-Crossref-Index.md`.
- `C6-TT-Taxonomy/TT-Taxonomy-Index.md`: Exists at root. Must migrate to `reference/TT-Taxonomy-Index.md`.
- `C7-IO-Registry/IO-Registry-Index.md`: Exists at root. Must migrate to `reference/IO-Registry-Index.md`.

**Action:** Full 10-patch migration and rebuild session initiated.
