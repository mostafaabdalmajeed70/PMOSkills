## 1. Purpose

Plan Risk Responses develops suitable and effective options, selects strategies, and agrees on actions to address individual risks and the overall project risk exposure recorded in the A19 Risk Register. This skill transforms the priority-ranked, scored A19 register — produced by SKL-03-11 — into an actionable response plan: every High and Very High entry gets a named strategy, a response owner, a trigger condition, and an action set that can be directly implemented in SKL-04 (Implement Risk Responses).

---

## 2. Scope

This skill covers:
- Selecting and documenting a response strategy for every A19 entry with status "Analysis Complete — Response Required" or "Analysis Complete — Watch and Plan"
- Designing specific response actions, owners, trigger conditions, and estimated costs
- Selecting strategies for overall project risk (distinct from individual risk strategies)
- Applying contingent response strategies where appropriate
- Designing consolidated responses for risk clusters that share a root cause
- Designing exploitation and enhancement strategies for opportunities
- Estimating secondary and residual risk effects
- Feeding reserve sizing inputs to A16 and coordinating with A20
- Updating A19 with completed response plans
- Identifying cross-domain impacts and triggering change control via A12

This skill does **not** cover:
- Performing risk analysis (SKL-03-11)
- Executing response actions (SKL-04)
- Ongoing monitoring (SKL-05)
- Formally approving contingency reserve amounts in A16 (sponsor / finance authority)
- Identifying new risks (SKL-03-10)

## 4. Strategy Taxonomy

### 4.1 Strategies for Threats

| Strategy | Core Intent | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Escalate** | Move ownership outside the project | Threat exceeds PM authority or project scope of control |
| **Avoid** | Eliminate the threat entirely | High probability AND high impact; removal is feasible |
| **Transfer** | Shift ownership to a third party | Financial threats another party can bear more effectively |
| **Mitigate** | Reduce probability and/or impact | Cannot or should not avoid; cost of mitigation justified |
| **Accept** | Acknowledge; no proactive action | Low-priority threats; Active: contingency reserve; Passive: periodic review |

### 4.2 Strategies for Opportunities

| Strategy | Core Intent | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Escalate** | Move ownership outside the project | Opportunity exceeds PM authority |
| **Exploit** | Ensure the opportunity definitely occurs | High-priority; certainty of realization desired |
| **Share** | Partner with a third party | Opportunity is larger than the project can capture alone |
| **Enhance** | Increase probability and/or impact | Exploitation not feasible |
| **Accept** | Acknowledge; no proactive action | Low-priority; Active: contingency reserve; Passive: periodic review |

### 4.3 Strategies for Overall Project Risk

| Strategy | Applies To | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Avoid** | Negative overall risk | Take focused action to bring band below threshold; if unrestorable, may lead to project cancellation |
| **Exploit** | Positive overall risk | Focused action to capture the positive aggregate |
| **Transfer / Share** | Either polarity | Third-party involvement to manage aggregate exposure |
| **Mitigate / Enhance** | Negative / positive | Replan project elements to shift overall risk band |
| **Accept** | Either polarity | Active: establish overall contingency reserve; Passive: periodic review |

### 4.4 Contingent Response Strategies

Pre-agreed actions triggered by a defined event. Required fields: trigger condition, contingent action, response owner, response budget.

---

## 6. Tools and Techniques

Per PMBOK8 Figure 2-51: Expert Judgment, Interviews, Facilitation, Strategies for Threats (Section 4.1), Strategies for Opportunities (Section 4.2), Contingent Response Strategies (Section 4.4), Strategies for Overall Project Risk (Section 4.3), Alternative Analysis, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Multicriteria Decision Analysis.

**Cost-benefit rule:** \( \text{Response Benefit} = \text{Risk Score (pre-response)} - \text{Residual Risk Score (post-response)} \)

A response is cost-effective when: \( \text{Cost of Response} \leq \text{EMV Reduction Achieved} \)

---

## 7. Response Design Parameters

For every A19 entry receiving a response, populate:
- Response strategy and justification
- Specific response actions (concrete, implementable, verifiable)
- Named response owner (not a team or role)
- Trigger condition (observable event or monitoring frequency)
- Estimated response cost and reserve type
- Residual risk score and band
- Secondary risks (new A19 entries)
- Fallback plan (Very High entries)
- Post-response status target

---

## 8. Residual Risk and Secondary Risk

**Residual risk:** Remaining exposure after response is fully implemented. Must fall within acceptable threshold; if still High/Very High, escalate to sponsor via A12.

**Secondary risk:** New risk arising from implementing a response. Must be added as a new A19 entry and scheduled for SKL-03-11 analysis.

---

## 9. Opportunity Response Principle

Every opportunity with band High or Very High must have a named strategy (Exploit or Enhance) with rationale. Every opportunity response must have a named owner. Accepted opportunities must include a note on why exploitation was not cost-effective.

---

## 10. Reserve Integration

**Contingency reserve (known risks):** Sum Accept-Active amounts + contingent response costs. Priority: A20 recommendation if available; otherwise sum from A19 entries. Submit to finance authority for approval — PM does not self-approve.

**Management reserve (unknown risks):** PM and sponsor agree as % of cost baseline. Not managed at the individual risk level.

---

## 11. Response Design for Risk Clusters

When SKL-03-11 identified clusters sharing a root cause or cascade chain: design one consolidated response addressing the root cause. One cluster owner. Mark cluster entries in A19 to reference the cluster strategy.

---

## 12. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Confirm Prerequisites (Gate)
- [ ] SKL-03-11 complete: all A19 entries have analysis status
- [ ] Overall project risk band recorded in A19 header
- [ ] A19 risk appetite statement and escalation authority present
- [ ] A16 available
- [ ] If Track 2 ran: A20 available
- [ ] Very High entries: A12 escalation logged

### Step 2 — Retrieve Inputs
Sort A19 entries by priority band descending. Pull A19 header (overall band, clusters, cascade chains, sensitivity tags). Pull A04, A16, A20 (if available).

### Step 3 — Assess Overall Project Risk Strategy
Select overall strategy per Section 4.3 based on current overall band. Document in A19 header.

### Step 4 — Review Clusters and Cascade Chains
List all clusters. Determine which justify consolidated responses. Assign cluster response owners.

### Step 5 — Design Individual Responses (Very High First)
For each entry in priority order: evaluate strategy options; run cost-benefit analysis; select strategy; design actions; assign named owner; set trigger condition; estimate cost; assess residual risk; identify secondary risks.

**Priority rules:**
- Very High threats: Consider Avoid or Transfer before Mitigate; Accept requires governance approval
- Very High opportunities: Consider Exploit before Enhance; Accept requires documented rationale
- High threats: Mitigate standard; Transfer if structure supports it
- Medium: Accept-Active or Mitigate with contingent fallback
- Low / Watch-only: Accept-Passive; periodic review

### Step 6 — Design Responses for Watch-Only / Accept Entries
Accept-Passive: set monitoring frequency. Accept-Active: estimate contingency reserve amount.

### Step 7 — Opportunity Symmetry Check
- [ ] All High/Very High opportunities have named strategy
- [ ] All Exploit/Enhance have named owner and specific actions
- [ ] Escalated opportunities have confirmed recipients
- [ ] Opportunity contingency reserves noted separately from threat reserves

### Step 8 — Assess Residual Overall Project Risk
Will collective responses bring the overall band to acceptable level? If yes: record post-response expected band. If no: apply additional overall strategies or obtain formal sponsor acceptance via A12.

### Step 9 — Consolidate Reserve Demand
Sum contingency reserve demand. Combine with A20 if available. Submit to finance authority via A16/A20 update. PM does not self-approve.

### Step 10 — Identify Cross-Domain Impacts
Flag A15, A08, A16, A26, and procurement impacts. Log each as a change request in A12.

### Step 11 — Update A19
Populate all response plan fields per Section 7. Update A19 header with overall strategy, post-response band, date, strategy distribution, reserve demand, and pending cross-domain impacts.

### Step 12 — Trigger Downstream
Hand off to SKL-04 with complete response plan summary.

## 14. Tailoring Guidance

| Dimension | Guidance |
|-----------|---------|
| Small / low-complexity | One action + one owner + one trigger per entry; verbal owner acceptance |
| Medium | Full response for High/Very High; simplified Accept for Medium/Low; cluster check mandatory |
| Large | Full response for all non-Watch entries; contingent response tables; formal fallback plans; A20 coordination |
| Adaptive / sprint | Embedded in sprint planning; contingent responses trigger during execution |
| Fixed-price contract | Transfer strategy already applied at contract level — document explicitly; focus remaining entries on residual and secondary risks |
| Re-run | Re-plan only entries with changed band, fired triggers, or new entries from latest SKL-03-11 run |

---

## 15. Failure Cases
