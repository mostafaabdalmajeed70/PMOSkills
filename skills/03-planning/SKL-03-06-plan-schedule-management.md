# SKL-03-06 — Plan Schedule Management

**Skill ID:** SKL-03-06  
**Pack:** 03 — Planning  
**Status:** Draft · Tests Defined

## Purpose

Define how the project schedule will be developed, monitored, and controlled. The output is the Schedule Management section of A06, which governs all scheduling activities from sequencing through control.

---

## Scope

This skill produces the Schedule Management Plan section of A06. It does not build the schedule itself (that is part of SKL-03-01 integration and downstream execution). It defines the rules, tools, and approach for schedule management.

## Inputs Required

| Input | Source | Mandatory? |
|---|---|---|
| A04 — Project Charter | SKL-02-01 | Yes |
| A11 — WBS | SKL-03-05 | Yes |
| A05 — EEF/OPA | SKL-01-01 | Yes |

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Define Scheduling Methodology
1. Select the scheduling method: Critical Path Method (CPM), Critical Chain, Rolling Wave, or hybrid.
2. Define the scheduling tool (e.g., MS Project, Primavera, spreadsheet).
3. Record in A06 Schedule Management section.

### Step 2 — Define Schedule Level of Detail
1. Define the level of decomposition for schedule activities (activity = work package or sub-work-package).
2. Define the reporting period (weekly, bi-weekly).
3. Define milestone criteria (what constitutes a schedule milestone).
4. Record in A06.

### Step 3 — Define Schedule Variance Thresholds
1. Define acceptable schedule variance (e.g., ±5% SPI, ±2 weeks float).
2. Define what triggers a schedule recovery plan.
3. Define escalation path for schedule variance per A05 governance tiers.
4. Record in A06.

### Step 4 — Define Schedule Change Control
1. Define what constitutes a schedule change requiring A12 entry.
2. Define the approval authority for schedule baseline changes per A05 governance.
3. Record in A06.

### Step 5 — Baseline Schedule Management Section
1. Review with sponsor or PMO.
2. Record version, date, and approval.
