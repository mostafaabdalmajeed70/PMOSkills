## Purpose

Manage Communications executes the delivery plan defined in A28 — creating, distributing, storing, and retrieving project information according to the planned methods, frequencies, and formats for each stakeholder.

---

## Communication Methods

| Method | Description | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Interactive | Real-time two-way exchange (meetings, calls, video) | Decisions, negotiations, complex topics |
| Push | Information sent to recipients without requesting response (email, reports, memos) | Status updates, distribution of documents |
| Pull | Information stored for stakeholder to access on demand (intranet, dashboards, repositories) | Reference materials, large audiences, self-service |

---

## Inputs

| Input | Artifact | Section | Status required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Communications plan | A28 | Plan section | Complete |
| Performance data | A17 | Current period | Current |
| Stakeholder access levels | A28 | Sensitivity/access section | Current |
| Engagement events | A07 | Delivery log entries | Current |

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Review A28 Delivery Schedule
Confirm all scheduled communications for the current period: stakeholder, type, method, format, sender, sensitivity.

### Step 2 — Create Communication Packages
Prepare each item per A28 specifications: depth matched to stakeholder need, format applied, sensitivity confirmed.

### Step 3 — Distribute Communications
Deliver via planned channel. Record in A28 delivery log: stakeholder, type, method, date/time, sender, status.

### Step 4 — Manage Feedback and Responses
For Interactive communications: capture decisions and action items; record in A28; update A07 SEAM; log A18 issues.

### Step 5 — Issue Performance Reports
Issue all scheduled performance reports referencing A17 data, per A28 audience specification.

### Step 6 — Manage Communication Records
Store all communications per A28 storage and retrieval requirements and A05 OPA retention period.

## Outputs

| Output | Artifact | Section |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery log (all communications sent) | A28 | Delivery log |
| Performance reports issued | A17 | Reporting section |
| A07 updates from interactive comms | A07 | Engagement section |
| Issues from communications | A18 | Issue log (if applicable) |

---

## Operating Rules

1. Every scheduled communication must have an A28 delivery log entry whether sent on time, delayed, or cancelled.
2. Delayed communications must note the reason and rescheduled delivery date.
3. Performance reports must reference A17 data — standalone data not traceable to A17 is not acceptable.
4. No communication distributes information at a sensitivity level above the stakeholder's classified access level per A28.
5. Interactive communication outcomes that include decisions or commitments must be recorded within 24 hours.

---

## Failure Modes

| Failure mode | Detection signal | Corrective action |
|---|---|---|
| Missing delivery log entries | Stakeholder asks why they did not receive a communication | Audit A28 delivery log; identify gaps; re-send if needed |
| Report data not from A17 | Performance report contains data not in A17 | Retract; reissue with A17-sourced data |
| Access level breach | Information distributed to unauthorized stakeholder | Immediate notification; A18 issue; A06 escalation |
| Interactive decisions undocumented | Team acts on verbal decisions with no record | Immediate A28 entry; confirm with participants |
| Language or translation gap | Stakeholder reports misunderstanding from non-native language content | Arrange translation or plain-language rewrite; re-send; flag in A28 |
| Communications tool access failure | Stakeholder unable to receive due to platform or access issue | Identify alternative channel; re-send; update A28 with fallback channel |
