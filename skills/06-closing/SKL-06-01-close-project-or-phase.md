## Early Termination Procedure

When a project is terminated before completion, this skill governs documentation of closure under termination conditions:

1. Document the reasons for termination in the Project Closure Record
2. Identify the state of all in-progress work and deliverables
3. Confirm which, if any, deliverables are accepted in their current state
4. Close all contracts per termination clauses
5. Release all resources immediately
6. Update Lessons Learned with findings from the termination
7. Archive all records
8. Obtain formal closure authorization from sponsor or governing body

---

## Authority Routing

| Decision | Authority Level | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Approve project closure | Sponsor + Governing Body | T3 |
| Accept final deliverables | Customer / Sponsor-delegated authority | T2 |
| Close individual contracts | Project Manager + Procurement authority | T2 |
| Approve early termination | Governing Body or Portfolio authority | T3–T4 |
| Archive records | PMO / Project Manager | T1 |
| Release personnel | Project Manager + HR | T1–T2 |

---

## Tests

| Test ID | Test Description | Pass Condition | Fail Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| T01 | All deliverables listed in Acceptance Register | Every deliverable has accepted-by name and date | Any row missing sign-off |
| T02 | Issue Log fully resolved | All issues = Closed or Deferred with notation | Any open issue without deferral note |
| T03 | All contracts confirmed closed | Procurement log shows Closed status for each contract | Any contract status = Active or Open |
| T04 | Lessons Learned archived to OPA | A21 status = Archived; PMO archive reference present | A21 status = Draft at closure |
| T05 | Final Report distributed | A17 distribution record exists | No distribution record |
| T06 | Transition confirmed | Receiving entity sign-off present in A27 §10 | Section 10 blank |
| T07 | Project Closure Record fully signed | All signature rows in §11 populated | Any signature row blank |
| T08 | Early termination procedure followed (if applicable) | All 8 steps documented if closure type = Early Termination | Steps missing or incomplete |

## Failure Cases

|---|---|---|
| Closure initiated before all deliverables accepted | Unsigned acceptance rows in register | Obtain sign-off or document formal deferral |
| Open contracts not closed | Procurement log shows active contracts | Engage procurement authority for formal closure |
| Resources released without OPA update | HR records show reassigned but no closure record | Complete administrative closure before release confirmation |
| Lessons Learned not archived | A21 status = draft at closure | Finalize and archive to OPA before signing closure record |
| Transition not confirmed | No receiving entity sign-off | Obtain formal transition acceptance before closure |
