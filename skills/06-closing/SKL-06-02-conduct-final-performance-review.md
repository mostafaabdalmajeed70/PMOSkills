## Purpose

Conduct a structured, final analysis of project performance across all baseline dimensions — scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, and stakeholder satisfaction — to produce the Final Report and determine whether the project met its objectives. This skill supports organizational learning, governance accountability, and historical data archiving.

---

## Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|---|---|
| Final scope performance (planned vs. delivered) | Benefits realization measurement (post-project) |
| Final schedule performance (SPI, critical path actuals) | Operational performance post-transition |
| Final cost performance (CPI, EAC, VAC, EVM summary) | Portfolio-level performance reporting |
| Final quality results vs. quality objectives | |
| Final risk outcome summary | |
| Stakeholder satisfaction assessment | |
| Lessons learned summary input | |

---

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this skill when:
- All project work is substantially complete and deliverables have been accepted
- SKL-06-01 (Close Project or Phase) is being executed
- Sponsor or PMO requests a formal project performance review before closure sign-off
- Phase closure gate requires performance evidence before phase progression

## Tools and Techniques

| Tool / Technique | Application |
|---|---|
| Data Analysis — Document Analysis | Review all project documents for completeness and accuracy |
| Data Analysis — Variance Analysis | Compare actual scope, schedule, cost, quality vs. baselines |
| Data Analysis — Trend Analysis | Identify performance trends across the project lifecycle |
| Data Analysis — Regression Analysis | Identify relationships between performance variables |
| Earned Value Analysis (EVM) | Final CPI, SPI, EAC, ETC, VAC, TCPI computation |
| Expert Judgment | Interpret results; assess whether variances are acceptable |
| Meetings | Final review meeting with sponsor, PMO, key stakeholders |

---

## EVM Final Metrics Reference

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **SPI** (Schedule Performance Index) | EV / PV | >1 = ahead; <1 = behind |
| **CPI** (Cost Performance Index) | EV / AC | >1 = under budget; <1 = over budget |
| **EAC** (Estimate at Completion) | BAC / CPI | Projected final cost |
| **ETC** (Estimate to Complete) | EAC − AC | Remaining work cost |
| **VAC** (Variance at Completion) | BAC − EAC | Positive = under budget |
| **TCPI** (To-Complete Performance Index) | (BAC − EV) / (BAC − AC) | Efficiency needed to meet BAC |
| **SV** (Schedule Variance) | EV − PV | Positive = ahead of schedule |
| **CV** (Cost Variance) | EV − AC | Positive = under budget |

## Outputs

| Output | Artifact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Final Report (A17 — Final Version) | A17 | Primary output — formal project performance record |
| Lessons Learned Register (updated) | A21 | Performance review insights captured |
| OPA Updates | OPA | Historical performance data for future projects |

| Archive historical performance data | Project Manager + PMO | T1 |

---

## Validation Criteria

This skill output is valid when:
- [ ] Final Report covers all 9 performance dimensions (scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, stakeholders, procurement, benefits, lessons learned)
- [ ] All EVM metrics are computed from actual final data, not estimates
- [ ] Variance root causes are documented for all variances > threshold
- [ ] Lessons Learned summary references the full A21 register
- [ ] Final Report has been approved by sponsor
- [ ] Report is archived to OPA before project closure record is signed

---

## Failure Cases

| Failure | Indicator | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Performance data incomplete at time of review | Blank cells in EVM table | Return to SKL-05-01 to collect outstanding WPI |
| EVM metrics not reconciled to final actuals | EAC differs from finance system | Reconcile with Finance before issuing Final Report |
| Benefits realization section left blank | No benefits owner named | Engage PMO/sponsor to assign post-project benefits owner |
| Quality results not captured | Quality reports section empty | Pull from A30 Quality Reports archive |
| Report not approved before closure | Missing signature block | Do not sign Project Closure Record until Final Report approved |
