# AUTHORITY-ROUTING.md
**Repository:** PMO Skill Repository  
**Version:** 1.0.0-draft  
**Authority:** Artifacts-Authorities-V-1.1.md · PMBOK8 Governance Performance Domain §2.1  
**Purpose:** Single reference for decision routing. Use this file in any skill, agent, or MCP tool that needs to route a decision to the correct approval authority.

---

## Core Routing Principles

1. Authority is assigned by **decision type, threshold, risk, and governance layer** — not by seniority alone.
2. **Project, portfolio, and PMO governance remain separate** unless a documented escalation path joins them.
3. The **project manager owns routine operational decisions** within delegated limits.
4. The **sponsor or project governing body** approves decisions that change value assumptions, authority boundaries, or major commitments.
5. **PMO authorities** govern PMO services, methods, and improvement priorities; they do not automatically override project governance.
6. **Portfolio authorities** govern sequencing, priority, and shared-capacity trade-offs across initiatives.
7. **Specialist authorities** (procurement, legal, security, privacy, finance, quality, HR) approve decisions in their domains when policy requires it.

## Governance Layer Reference

| Layer | Primary Purpose | Typical Authority Owner | Typical Decision Scope |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Organizational Governance | Enterprise direction, policy, compliance | Executive leadership, governing body | Strategy, policy, enterprise compliance |
| OPM Governance | Strategic alignment across portfolios/programs/projects | OPM governing body, portfolio forums | Cross-enterprise alignment and investment prioritization |
| PMO Governance | PMO services, methods, enablement, improvement | PMO leader, PMO governance forum | Methods, templates, coaching, improvement backlog |
| Portfolio/Program/Project Governance | Prioritization, authorization, oversight, value delivery | Portfolio board, sponsor, project governing body | Intake, baseline changes, risk tolerance, acceptance, closure |
| Delivery Team Ways of Working | Day-to-day execution, cadence, collaboration | Project manager, delivery lead, team | Operational decisions within approved tolerances |

---

## T1–T4 Decision Threshold Model

| Band | Characteristics | Default Decision Authority |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **T1 Operational** | Localized effect, low risk, inside approved plan tolerances | Project manager or designated lead |
| **T2 Controlled Change** | Material effect on one baseline or one major commitment, within project authority | Sponsor-delegated board, change authority, or functional authority |
| **T3 Governance Change** | Cross-baseline effect, major financial/schedule/value impact, or authority boundary shift | Project governing body or sponsor |
| **T4 Enterprise Portfolio** | Cross-project, strategic, regulatory, or enterprise-service impact | Portfolio authority, PMO governance forum, or executive authority |

Use organization-defined numeric thresholds where available. Apply qualitative routing otherwise.

## Decision Category Reference Table

| Decision Category | Default Authority | Escalate When |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Routine delivery coordination | Project manager or delivery lead | Crosses delegated tolerance, impacts another project, or changes approved baselines |
| Team operating model and responsibilities | Project manager or delivery lead | Changes formal authority boundaries, labor commitments, or organization structure |
| Resource acquisition and allocation | Project manager within delegated limits | Exceeds staffing or spend authority, or creates cross-project conflicts |
| Baseline change | Project governing body or delegated change authority | The change exceeds thresholds for cost, schedule, scope, or value |
| Portfolio priority or sequencing | Portfolio authority | Shared strategic capacity or benefit timing is materially affected |
| PMO service engagement | PMO leader or service owner | A service change affects policy, tooling standards, or enterprise operating model |
| Procurement award | Procurement authority and sponsor as required | Thresholds, legal exposure, or regulated sourcing rules apply |
| Supplier claim, dispute, or compliance | Procurement/legal/sponsor depending on case | Contract exposure, audit risk, or litigation risk increases |
| AI, privacy, or data-control exception | Security/privacy/compliance authority | Sensitive data, regulated use, or automated decision risk is involved |
| Closure and benefits transition | Sponsor or business owner | Ongoing benefit ownership, residual risk, or operational handover is unclear |

## Escalation Path Rules

1. Escalate PM → Sponsor or delegated change authority when a decision moves from **T1 to T2**.
2. Escalate to the **project governing body** when a decision alters approved scope, funding, schedule, expected value, or decision-right boundaries at **T3**.
3. Escalate to **portfolio governance** when the decision affects priority, sequencing, or shared capacity across more than one initiative.
4. Escalate to **PMO governance** when the decision changes a PMO service, method, template family, enterprise tooling pattern, or PMO maturity target.
5. Escalate to **procurement, legal, security, privacy, finance, quality, or HR** authorities when policy or regulation requires specialist approval.
6. **Record the escalation path in the governing artifact** — do not maintain a disconnected escalation log unless regulation requires one.

## RACI Default Model

| Role | Default Interpretation |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Responsible** | Prepares or updates the artifact |
| **Accountable** | Holds the delegated authority to approve or own the decision |
| **Consulted** | Provides specialist input before approval |
| **Informed** | Receives the result or status after decision |

Keep **one accountable role per artifact decision** when possible.
