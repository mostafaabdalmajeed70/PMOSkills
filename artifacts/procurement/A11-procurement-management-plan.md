# A11 — Procurement Management Plan

**Artifact ID:** A11
**Name:** Procurement Management Plan
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Source Type:** PMI-derived
**Governance Layer:** Project Governance
**Authority:** PMBOK8 Guide Appendix X4 Procurement; Table 2-1 Plan Procurement Management

## 1. Purpose

The Procurement Management Plan describes how the project will acquire goods, services, or results from outside the project team. It defines the procurement strategy, contract types to be used, supplier selection approach, roles and responsibilities, and how procurement activities will be administered and closed.

It answers the question: *What will be procured, how, from whom, under what contract structure, and who is responsible for managing the supplier relationship?* It is the governing reference for all procurement activities from make-or-buy decisions through contract closure.

---

## 2. Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|---|---|
| Make-or-buy decisions for project work | Individual contract documents (governed by A31) |
| Procurement strategy and sourcing approach | Supplier evaluation scores and award decisions (governed by A32) |
| Contract types to be used | Supplier claims or dispute records (governed by A33) |
| Supplier selection criteria and process | Vendor performance data (maintained in A31 as a living record) |
| Procurement roles and responsibilities | Financial baseline and cost estimates (belong in A16) |
| Procurement schedule and milestones | Risk register entries for procurement risks (belong in A19) |
| Contract administration approach | Organizational procurement policy (an OPA referenced from A05) |
| Procurement closure approach | Post-project benefits realization |

---

## 3. Trigger Conditions

The Procurement Management Plan is created when:

- Planning identifies that project work will require external procurement of goods, services, or results.
- A make-or-buy analysis confirms that one or more work packages will be procured.
- Regulatory, contractual, or organizational policy requires a documented procurement approach.

The plan is updated when:

- A new procurement need is identified during execution that was not anticipated at planning.
- Contract type or sourcing strategy changes for an approved procurement package.
- Organizational procurement policy changes affect the project's procurement authority.
