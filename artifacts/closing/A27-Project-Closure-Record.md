# A27 — Project Closure Record

**Artifact ID:** A27  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Template · Active  
**Pack:** 06 — Closing  
**Primary skill:** SKL-06-01 — Close Project or Phase  
**File path:** `artifacts/closing/A27-Project-Closure-Record.md`

---

## Purpose

The Project Closure Record is the authoritative closing document for a project or project phase. It confirms that all deliverables have been formally accepted, all contractual and financial obligations have been settled, all organizational process assets (OPA) have been updated, and the project has been formally closed by the appropriate authority.

A27 is the final mandatory artifact of the project lifecycle. Nothing closes without it.

---

## Operating Rules

1. **One record per closure event.** A separate A27 is produced for each phase closure and for final project closure. Phase closure records feed the final closure record.
2. **Formal acceptance required.** Every deliverable in A08 must have a corresponding acceptance entry in Section 3 before this record can be approved.
3. **Financial settlement required.** A16 final financial data must be reconciled before Section 5 can be completed.
4. **OPA transfer required.** A21 closure knowledge package must be transferred to the organizational knowledge base before final closure approval.
5. **Sponsor or governance body approval required.** The PM cannot self-approve closure.
6. **Premature closure uses Section 7.** If the project is terminated before completion, Section 7 must be completed in addition to the applicable standard sections.
